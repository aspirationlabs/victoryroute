## Planning Guidelines
- When you make a set of tool calls that fail, let the user know what you tried to do that failed. And re-evaluate if you feel confident to make a plan, or need to ask clarifying questions to get the information you were trying to seek.

## Python Development
- This is not a Bazel project.
- Use `pytest:*` directly to run unit test suite, or target specific tests.
- Comments must not duplicate code. Good function and variable names are often enough to remove the need for comments. So on a second review pass, make sure you've cleaned up all comments originally used to guide your first pass to adhere to this.
