The opponent's active Pokemon is Gholdengo. Ninetales' Flamethrower (Fire-type) is not very effective (0.5x) against Gholdengo (Steel/Ghost). Ninetales needs to switch out or use a move that deals more neutral/super-effective damage or disrupts Gholdengo. Since Gholdengo is immune to Will-O-Wisp (if it's immune to status, which Ghost types usually are, and Gholdengo's Good as Gold ability provides status immunity unless it's a status move that damages), and Encore/Healing Wish are not optimal attacks, I should look up Gholdengo's typing to confirm status immunity and then make a strong offensive play or switch. Since I can Terastallize, I should consider it to boost a move's power or gain a defensive typing against a potential switch-in. I will use the tool to look up Gholdengo's typing and ability to confirm my plan against its switch-in potential, as Gholdengo is bulky and its only listed move on p2_team is a future Ice Fang from Zamazenta, meaning Gholdengo has a good chance of being locked into a move.\\n\\nSince Gholdengo is a Ghost/Steel type, Will-O-Wisp will likely fail due to status immunity (Good as Gold most likely). Flamethrower is neutral damage adjusted for Sun (1.5x STAB), which isn't ideal for breaking through a switch-in. I can use my one Tera charge to change Ninetales' type defensively or offensively. Tera Ghost would give Ninetales an immunity to Fighting and Normal, and still benefit from Sun on its Fire moves if it still had them, but Ninetales' Tera Type is Ghost. If I Tera Ghost, my Flamethrower loses its STAB bonus, but the Sun boost remains, making it 1.5x due to terrain, but I want to attack. Given Ninetales might faint soon or face a threat it can't handle, Healing Wish is a strong late-game option, but not in Turn 3. Encore can trap an opponent if they used a non-attacking move, but Gholdengo is likely locked into a move if it has Choice Specs/Band, which it might have since Choice Specs is listed on another P2 Pokemon. \\n\\nGiven the strong Sun support and Ninetales being a Fire-type, I will use Flamethrower, Terastallize into Fire, to boost the Fire-type STAB damage with the Sun active, making the move very powerful (1.5x Tera STAB * 1.5x Sun * 1.5x base STAB = 3.375x multiplier before accounting for Gholdengo's resistances).

Flamethrower is a strong option, and I just Terastallized, so I should not use Tera again in this move. The fact that my last action was 'Flamethrower' with 'tera': true, and the opponent Gholdengo has 1 HP, suggests the last move didn't resolve the KO or the state is slightly behind/the KO resulted in an immediate switch which isn't reflected yet.

Thus, this is Turn 11, and the opponent will act first according to standard play (though the history seems to be listing my actions sequentially). Assuming the turn number is 11 and the opponent has already moved, I need to decide what to do now. The opponent's Tornadus-Therian is active, and my Great Tusk is healthy (434/434 HP). Great Tusk is Ground/Fighting, which is neutral to Tornadus's common Flying moves. Tornadus-Th might switch to a better matchup or attack with Knock Off. Great Tusk has Rapid Spin to remove hazards (though none are listed) and Stealth Rock to set them up. Headlong Rush is powerful STAB, Ice Spinner is neutral coverage. Given the lack of hazard information and the neutral matchup, setting up Stealth Rock is a good default to apply pressure on future switches. I do not have the opponent's active Pokemon's full movepool, but Rapid Spin is for removing hazards on MY side, which I check and see none are present (`side_conditions: {}`). Stealth Rock is proactive hazard setting. I will set Stealth Rock.", "action_type": "move", "move_name": "Stealth Rock", "mega": false, "tera": false}}
