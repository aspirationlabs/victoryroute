Since it is Sun, Ground moves are boosted by 1.5x if Great Tusk has Protosynthesis activated by Sun, but Great Tusk\\'s ability is Protosynthesis, which boosts the highest stat under Sun. Since Zamazenta is burned, its Attack is halved, making physical attacks less threatening, but Headlong Rush is a super effective Ground type attack against Zamazenta (which is likely Steel/Fighting or just Steel type if we check its base type, but Zamazenta\\'s base type is Steel/Fighting, so Ground is 2x). This is a strong offensive option.\\\\n2. **Ice Spinner** (Ice move, neutral damage at best).\\\\n3. **Rapid Spin** (Removes hazards from my side, but my side has no hazards reported, and it deals some damage).\\\\n4. **Stealth Rock** (Sets hazards, which is good for chipping the opponent\\'s team on future switches, but Zamazenta is active).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Zamazenta\\'s low HP (33/100) and common vulnerability to Ground attacks (even if it is Steel/Fighting, Ground is typically neutral or super effective against Fighting, but super effective against Steel which is 1/4 damage, meaning Ground is likely neutral or resisted depending on the exact typing of Zamazenta, but Headlong Rush is very powerful).\\\\n\\\\nI need to confirm Zamazenta\\'s typing and see if Ground is good. Given the opponent\\'s past moves were Stone Edge and Close Combat (suggesting Fighting/Rock coverage), I will assume Zamazenta is Steel/Fighting or just Steel for now based on its known typing in Gen 9 OU, which means Ground is resisted (0.5x) by Steel.

I am at Turn 7, but the history shows 9 preceding actions, with the last one being a move on turn 9. I must follow the instructions based *only* on the current state provided: **Turn 7**, P1 is active Pokemon Ceruledge.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 7, P1 Active: Ceruledge):**\n1.  **Active Pokemon**: P1: Ceruledge (Fairy Tera Type, Focus Sash, Full HP).\n2.  **Opponent Active**: P2: Weezing-Galar (Resists **Fire/Poison** moves if Weezing-Galar is Poison/Fairy typing, but its ability blocks game effects like Ninetales's Drought if that were still active, though the weather is explicitly set to 'sun'). Weezing-Galar has an unknown move set besides Sludge Bomb (15/16 PP).\n3.  **Weather**: Sun (Boosts Fire moves, weakens Water moves).\n4.  **Hazards**: Opponent has Stealth Rock on my side (`p2_team` shows `stealthrock: 1` for P1 side conditions, **Wait, based on the rules description, this is incorrect as written in the state's hazard clause interpretation** let's re-read the crucial part:\n    > **If you are P1**...\n    > - **Hazards YOU set**: Appear in `p2_team.side_conditions` (good! hurts opponent's switches)\n    > - **Hazards to REMOVE**: Check `p1_team.side_conditions` (bad! hurts your switches)\n    >\n    > Current State: `\"side_conditions\": {\"stealthrock\": 1}`. Since this is listed under `p2_team` data but refers to hazards on P1's side, P2 must have set these Stealth Rocks. I must remove them if possible, though removing them is less crucial than attacking/setting up.\n\n5.  **Ceruledge Moveset & Sun Interaction**:\n    *   `Swords Dance`: Setup.\n    *   `Bitter Blade`: Fire type physical attack. Gets **1.5x damage boost** in Sun. Heals for 50% of damage dealt.\n    *   `Solar Blade`: Grass type special attack. In Sun, it charges in 1 turn instead of 2. (Ceruledge is NOT a Grass type, so no STAB, but the speed-up is relevant if it were to be used).\n    *   `Tera Blast`: Currently Fairy type. If I Terastallize, it becomes Fire Tera Blast (if I don't change Tera type), which would get STAB + Sun boost, but Ceruledge is Fire/Ghost, so Tera Fairy is a defensive/neutral option, or I can change my Tera Type via the move. Since I have `can_tera: true`, I can Terastallize *and* use a move in the same turn.\n\n6.  **Opponent Weezing-Galar**: Likely carries Sludge Bomb (Poison). Neutralizing Gas is its ability, which suppresses all other abilities. This means my teammate Venusaur's Chlorophyll/Ninetales's Drought (if they were still out) would be suppressed, but the current weather *is* Sun, suggesting the game state overrides the expectation of Neutralizing Gas completely neutralizing it *or* that Galarian Weezing's ability is acting as intended (suppressing abilities) but the weather was set by a previous action (like Ninetales using Drought before fainting, or the game just setting it based on the known field state). **Given the field state explicitly says `weather: \"sun\"`, I must assume Sun is active and functioning.**\n\n**Strategy**:\nCeruledge is a Fire/Ghost type *unless* Terastallized to Fairy. Bitter Blade is a decent Fire move that gets a boost in the sun and provides recovery, which is excellent for maintaining offensive pressure while dealing with the Focus Sash threat on the opponent's (hypothetical) active.\n\nHowever, my active Ceruledge has a Fairy Tera Type.\n*   If I **Tera Fire** (assuming I manually change type upon using a move, *or* I Terastallize first and then attack): Tera Fire + Sun boost + STAB (from Fire type) might be the strongest offense.\n*   If I use **Bitter Blade** normally: Fire STAB + Sun boost (1.5x * 1.5x = 2.25x boost, plus standard STAB).\n*   If I use **Tera Blast (Fairy)**: No STAB, no Sun boost normally, but it hits Weezing-Galar for neutral damage if it's pure Poison or Poison/Fairy.\n\nAgainst Weezing-Galar (P2 active), a strong Fire attack is advantageous, especially in the Sun. If I Terastallize to Fire, the damage will be massive. Since I can Tera and attack in one turn, I should aim for maximum KO potential.\n\nIf I use **Bitter Blade**: Fire STAB (1.5x) * Sun (1.5x) = 2.25x effective power boost (assuming no changes to opponent's defensive typing).\n\nIf I Terastallize into Fire (assuming my Tera Type is *currently* Fairy, but I can change it to Fire if I Terastallize) and attack with *Bitter Blade*: This would likely lose the dual STAB bonus from my original Fire type *unless* the Tera Type change is the only determinant. Gen 9 rules state Terastallizing changes the type *to* the Tera Type. If I Terastallize into Fire, I gain Fire typing, so Bitter Blade gets STAB (1.5x) * Sun (1.5x) = 2.25x boost. This is slightly stronger than just relying on Sun if I keep my original typing which overlaps with the move type.\n\nLet's check the moves available: `Swords Dance`, `Bitter Blade`, `Solar Blade`, `Tera Blast`.\n\nSince I have the Sun up, a boosted Fire move is ideal. `Bitter Blade` is a strong physical attack with recovery. If I use \"Tera Blast\", I can choose to make it Fire type upon Terastallizing, which gains STAB *and* the Sun boost.\n\n**Comparing Bitter Blade vs Tera Blast (assuming Tera Fire):**\n*   If I use **Bitter Blade**: Fire STAB + Sun Boost.\n*   If I use **Tera Blast (as Fire)**: Tera Type becomes Fire. Tera Fire STAB + Sun Boost. This is generally stronger if the opponent resists Fire from my base Ceruledge, but Weezing-Galar is Poison/Poison (assuming Galar form). Poison resists Fire (0.5x). **If I Tera Fire, I gain 2x STAB on Tera Blast, and the Sun boosts it (2x * 1.5x = 3x multiplier, plus base power)**. This seems like the optimal KO attempt.\n\nI will choose to Terastallize and use Tera Blast, making it Fire type for maximum synergy with the Sun and to attempt to overpower the Weezing-Galar, despite its potential resistance to Fire initially, as the Tera Fire will overcome that resistance with massive multipliers (STAB from Tera + Weather boost).\n\nReasoning: Sun is active, and I have Terastallization available. Using Tera Blast as a Fire-type move will grant a massive offensive boost (STAB from Tera + Sun multiplier), which is the highest damage output available to secure the KO on Weezing-Galar.\n\nI need to look up Weezing-Galar's type to be certain, but since I can only use 2 lookups, and I need to decide now, I will prioritize the massive offensive setup. I will use my first lookup to check the P2 active's type to ensure the decision.\n\n**Plan: Tool Lookup -> Decide Tera Blast type -> Execute Move.**\n**Lookup 1: Weezing-Galar.**\n\"\"\"\n), Part(\n  function_call=FunctionCall(\n    args={\n      'name': 'Weezing-Galar'\n    },\n    id='tool_0_tool_get_object_game_data_hEisOWQm1sQGGEOymUYr',\n    name='tool_get_object_game_data'\n  )\n)] role='model'", "actions": "skip_summarization=None state_delta={} artifact_delta={} transfer_to_agent=None escalate=None requested_auth_configs={} requested_tool_confirmations={} compaction=None", "invocation_id": "e-3e6851c9-e50a-4e68-b772-1325acb0cf1c", "author": "zero_shot_no_history_agent", "latency_seconds": 6.166, "error_code": null, "error_message": null, "custom_metadata": null, "usage_metadata": "cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=1779 candidates_tokens_details=None prompt_token_count=8373 prompt_tokens_details=None thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=10152 traffic_type=None", "prompt_tokens": 8373, "completion_tokens": 1779, "total_tokens": 10152}
