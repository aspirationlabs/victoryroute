# Generation 9 OU Battle Rules

This battle follows **Generation 9 Overused (Gen9OU)** competitive rules.

## Special Mechanics

### Terastallization
- You can **Terastallize once per battle** to change your Pokemon's type
- When Terastallized, the Pokemon's type changes to its Tera Type
- STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) applies: moves matching the Tera Type get 1.5x damage
- Original STAB bonus is reduced if the Tera Type doesn't match original types
- Use strategically - you cannot Terastallize again after using it once

- **HP Percentage Mod**: HP is displayed as percentages rather than exact values

## Strategic Implications

- Once used, you cannot Tera again - choose wisely!
