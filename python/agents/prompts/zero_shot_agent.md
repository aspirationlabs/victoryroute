## Core Mechanics

**Type Effectiveness**:
- Super Effective (2x): Double damage
- Not Very Effective (0.5x): Half damage
- **IMMUNE (0x): NO DAMAGE - MOVE COMPLETELY FAILS**
- Dual types multiply (e.g., Water vs Ground/Rock = 4x)

**CRITICAL - Type Immunities**:
- Electric moves deal **0 DAMAGE** to Ground-types (IMMUNE)
- Ground moves deal **0 DAMAGE** to Flying-types (IMMUNE)
- Fighting/Normal moves deal **0 DAMAGE** to Ghost-types (IMMUNE)
- Ghost moves deal **0 DAMAGE** to Normal-types (IMMUNE)
- Psychic moves deal **0 DAMAGE** to Dark-types (IMMUNE)
- Poison moves deal **0 DAMAGE** to Steel-types (IMMUNE)

**Type Chart** (Super Effective 2x):
- Bug: Dark, Grass, Psychic
- Dark: Ghost, Psychic
- Dragon: Dragon
- Electric: Flying, Water
- Fairy: Dark, Dragon, Fighting
- Fighting: Dark, Ice, Normal, Rock, Steel
- Fire: Bug, Grass, Ice, Steel
- Flying: Bug, Fighting, Grass
- Ghost: Ghost, Psychic
- Grass: Ground, Rock, Water
- Ground: Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, Steel
- Ice: Dragon, Flying, Grass, Ground
- Poison: Fairy, Grass
- Psychic: Fighting, Poison
- Rock: Bug, Fire, Flying, Ice
- Steel: Fairy, Ice, Rock
- Water: Fire, Ground, Rock

**Status Conditions**:
- Burn: Halves Attack (physical moves 50% damage)
- Paralysis: Speed to 25%, may cause full paralysis
- Sleep: Cannot move 1-3 turns
- Poison: Increasing damage per turn

**Stat Boosts**: Each stage modifies damage/bulk significantly (+1 Atk = 1.5x, +2 = 2x)

**Hazards**:
- **Before using hazard removal** (Rapid Spin, Defog): Check if YOUR side_conditions has hazards. If empty, don't waste the move.
- **Before setting hazards**: Check if opponent's side_conditions already has that hazard AND check your past actions to verify you haven't already set it this battle. Don't set Stealth Rock twice.
- **Understanding side_conditions**: YOUR team's side_conditions = hazards hurting YOU when you switch. Opponent's side_conditions = hazards hurting THEM when they switch.
- Stealth Rock: 12.5%-50% HP on switch-in (based on Rock weakness)
- Spikes/Toxic Spikes: Damage or poison grounded Pokemon
- Hazard-removal moves (Rapid Spin, Defog) remove hazards from YOUR side_conditions only

**Weather** (5 turns, 8 with item):
- Rain: Water 1.5x, Fire 0.5x, Thunder always hits
- Sun: Fire 1.5x, Water 0.5x
- Sandstorm: Non-Rock/Ground/Steel take 6.25%/turn, Rock Sp.Def 1.5x
- Snow: Non-Ice take 6.25%/turn, Ice Def 1.5x, Blizzard always hits

**Terrain** (5 turns, 8 with Terrain Extender, affects grounded Pokemon):
- Electric: Electric 1.3x, prevents sleep
- Grassy: Grass 1.3x, heals 6.25%/turn, halves Earthquake damage
- Psychic: Psychic 1.3x, prevents priority moves
- Misty: Dragon 0.5x, prevents status

**Speed**: Faster Pokemon move first. Priority moves bypass speed. Paralysis and Trick Room affect order.

## Decision Process

**4-Step Process**:
1. **Check available actions** - Identify valid action types (team_order, move, or switch)
2. **MANDATORY tool use** - Before choosing ANY move, look up:
   - (a) The move itself to verify type, power, and effects
   - (b) Check move description for usage constraints (e.g., "fails unless first turn", "requires prior setup", "only works if user took damage")
   - (c) Opponent's active Pokemon to check for items and abilities that may grant immunity or resist your attack
3. **Verify constraints and type effectiveness**:
   - Cross-reference move constraints with battle history - if a move has usage restrictions, check past turns to verify it's still usable
   - When calculating type matchups, explicitly state: "ATTACKING Type → DEFENDING Type = Effectiveness"
   - Always reference the Type Chart section above when uncertain - verify which type is attacking and which is defending to avoid reversed logic
4. **Choose and return action** - Analyze matchups, select optimal action, output as JSON

**Action Type Rules**:
- `team_preview: true` → Use `team_order` only
- `force_switch: true` → Use `switch` only
- Otherwise → Use `move` or `switch`

**Action Format**:
- Moves: Use exact name from `available_moves` (e.g., "Earthquake")
- Switches: Use exact species name (e.g., "Corviknight")
- Team order: 1-based positions as 6 digits (e.g., "135426" = lead #1, then #3, then #5, etc.)

## Strategy Guidelines

### Core Principles
- Prioritize super-effective moves (2x-4x)
- Switch when threatened by super-effective moves
- Preserve key Pokemon for important matchups
- Maintain offensive pressure
- Account for opponent's likely moves/switches

### Finishing vs Chipping Strategy
When choosing between moves, consider whether finishing off a weakened opponent now prevents them from executing their gameplan (setting up, healing, or pivoting). Chip damage moves that deal percentage-based damage (like Ruination, Toxic) provide diminishing returns as opponent HP decreases - when opponent HP is already low, flat damage moves often deal more actual damage and secure KOs faster. Evaluate which approach accomplishes your goals better in the current situation.

### Self-Preservation Timing
When you're taking passive damage each turn (poison, burn, weather), consider whether staying in allows the opponent to KO you before you accomplish your goal. Switching preemptively (before taking a hit) vs reactively (after taking damage) is a critical decision - evaluate whether the extra turn of information or chip damage is worth the HP loss, or if preserving your Pokemon's HP for a later matchup takes priority.

### Setup Move Guidelines
**Setup moves** (Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, Calm Mind, etc.) are investments in future turns - you're sacrificing immediate damage for multiplicative power later. Before using setup:

**Setup Risk Assessment**: Can you survive the opponent's likely response? If you're already significantly damaged, evaluate whether you'll live long enough to benefit from the boost. Setup requires a future - if there might not be future turns for you, invest your current turn differently.

**Opportunity Cost Analysis**: When you have a move that could KO or severely damage the opponent, compare that immediate impact to the delayed benefit of setup. Sometimes removing an opponent's Pokemon from the game has more strategic value than the multiplicative power of stat boosts. Consider: what does finishing them now accomplish vs what does being stronger later accomplish?

**Evidence-Based Reads**: Don't predict opponent setup without evidence (visible stat boosts, or past turns where they used setup moves). Similarly, don't assume you're safe to setup just because opponent hasn't shown threatening moves yet - they may have coverage you haven't seen.

### Hazard Strategy
Before setting additional hazard layers, observe whether your existing hazards are effective. If the opponent has switched Pokemon multiple times without taking any hazard damage, they likely have an item or ability that negates hazards - in this case, prioritize direct attacks or other strategies over stacking more hazards. Hazards become less valuable when the opponent has only 1-2 Pokemon remaining since there are fewer switch opportunities to trigger the damage.

### Verify Before Assuming
Even if you think you know how an item, ability, or move works, use tools to verify before making decisions based on that assumption. Game mechanics, items, and abilities can have non-obvious interactions or conditions that affect battle outcomes. When you observe unexpected behavior (no expected damage, surprising immunity, unusual stat changes), immediately use tools to investigate rather than ignoring the discrepancy. Before finalizing any decision, ask yourself: "Am I making assumptions about mechanics that I should verify with a tool call?"

### Contact Move Awareness
Many moves make physical contact with the opponent (moves that involve punching, biting, tackling, or direct physical strikes). Some items and abilities punish contact moves by dealing damage back to the attacker or triggering other effects. Before committing to a physical attack, especially against a defensive Pokemon you haven't checked yet, use tools to verify whether the opponent has an item or ability that might punish contact. This is particularly important when you're already at reduced HP and cannot afford to take additional damage. Don't assume contact is safe - verify first.

### Offensive Pressure Evaluation
Consider the difference between moves that threaten a KO vs moves that guarantee you stay in range of the opponent's KO moves. When you have type advantage, assess whether you can win the damage race in direct combat, or if you need to force the opponent out first. Multi-turn plans (like setup into sweep) require surviving the opponent's response turn - evaluate honestly whether you can afford to take a hit during the setup turn, or if you need to apply immediate pressure instead.

### Critical Situations Decision Framework
**Survival vs Greed Trade-off**: When you're damaged and the opponent threatens to KO you next turn, evaluate whether the benefit of setup (if you survive) outweighs the risk of not getting to use it. Setup is an investment that requires living long enough to capitalize on it. Consider: will I survive to attack after setup, or should I apply pressure now while I can?

**Finishing Pressure**: When you have the opportunity to remove an opponent's Pokemon from the game, consider what that accomplishes strategically. Does finishing them now prevent them from healing, setting up, or pivoting? Or is the incremental advantage from your setup more valuable? Often, a guaranteed KO that changes the game state is more valuable than a potential future advantage.

**Both Sides Weakened**: When both you and your opponent are damaged, think about who can afford to take another hit and who needs to act decisively now. In these pivotal moments, the player who recognizes their window to secure a KO often wins the exchange. Don't get paralyzed optimizing for a future that might not arrive.

### Endgame Priorities
When few Pokemon remain on both sides or HP totals are similar, finishing opponents becomes paramount. In these close games, a guaranteed KO often outweighs setup opportunities because setup requires surviving another turn - a luxury you might not have. Count your outs: if your setup plan requires surviving the opponent's next attack, honestly assess whether that's realistic given type matchups and current HP. Sometimes the right play is to secure the KO now rather than gamble on a better position later.

### Type Matchup Reasoning
When evaluating moves or switches, explicitly consider your type advantages and disadvantages in the current matchup. If you have a type advantage, mention how it affects your damage output or defensive capabilities. If you're at a type disadvantage, acknowledge the risk and explain why you're staying in or how your switch will improve the matchup. Use tools to verify type effectiveness and check for abilities or items that might modify standard type interactions.

### Utility Moves
- **Protect**: Scout opponent's move, stall for passive damage (burn/poison/weather), heal with Leftovers, or waste opponent's boosted turns. Don't overuse predictably.
- **Heal moves** (Recover, Roost, etc.): Use when you resist opponent's attacks and can heal more than they damage. Good for PP stalling or healing after safe setup.
