## Overview

This document breaks down the first major milestone into actionable sub-milestones. The goal is to have a locally hosted Pok√©mon Showdown server where a human can challenge and battle against a RandomAgent that makes randomized moves.

**First Milestone from PROJECT.md:**
> 1. **Data Sync**: Run scripts to pull latest game data from smogon/pokemon-showdown and convert to JSON ‚úÖ
> 2. **Build Simulator**: Implement core battle mechanics with comprehensive tests (foo.py + foo_test.py pattern)
>    - By this step, connect to a locally hosted Showdown server for a human to play against a basic agent with randomized actions.

## Completed Milestones

  - `docs/running_battles.md` - How to run battles with the agent
- Example usage:
  ```bash
  # RandomAgent waits for challenges
  python python/scripts/run_battle.py --username BotPlayer

  # RandomAgent challenges specific opponent
  python python/scripts/run_battle.py --username BotPlayer --opponent HumanPlayer

  # Use specific team
  python python/scripts/run_battle.py --username BotPlayer --team-index 0
  ```

## What's NOT Included (Deferred to Later Milestones)

To keep the first milestone achievable, the following are explicitly **out of scope**:

### Advanced Game Mechanics
- **Complex abilities**: Intimidate, Protosynthesis, Speed Boost, etc.
  - Stub: acknowledge ability exists, don't apply effects
  - Implement after basic flow works
- **Complex items**: Life Orb, Choice items, berries, etc.
  - Stub: items recognized but effects not applied
- **Complex move effects**: Multi-turn moves, partial trapping, etc.
  - Focus on basic damage moves and simple status moves
- **Entry hazard damage**: Stealth Rock damage on switch
  - Hazards tracked in state, but damage calculation deferred
- **Speed ties and RNG**: Simplified speed order for MVP
  - Implement deterministic speed (higher stat always faster)
  - Add proper RNG and speed ties later

### Advanced Features
- **Full damage calculator**: Use simplified damage formula
  - Approximate: (move power √ó attack / defense) √ó type effectiveness
  - Ignore: weather, abilities, items, screens, crits for MVP
- **Team building**: Use hardcoded/file-based teams
  - No team validation against rulesets yet
  - Just load teams and play
- **Replay parsing**: Not needed for live battles
  - Will be needed for training data, but later
- **Advanced evaluation**: Just get battles working
  - Evaluation metrics come in future milestones
- **Multi-battle support**: Single battle at a time
  - Battle ID filtering exists, but not tested
- **LLM agents**: Future milestone
  - First milestone is just random + human

### Polish & Optimization
- **Performance optimization**: Correctness first
  - Immutable state copies might be slow, optimize later
- **Error recovery**: Basic error handling only
  - Advanced reconnection, state recovery, etc. can come later
- **UI/UX**: Minimal CLI is fine
  - Better display formatting, color, etc. is nice-to-have
- **Documentation**: Code comments are enough
  - Full API docs, tutorials, etc. come later

## Success Criteria for Milestone 1

The first milestone is **complete** when:

1. ‚úÖ Game data is synced and loadable in Python
2. ‚úÖ Showdown protocol messages are parsed into typed events
3. ‚úÖ Battle state can be constructed and is immutable
4. ‚úÖ Events are applied to create new states with basic game logic
5. ‚úÖ Environment orchestrates event stream and state updates
6. ‚úÖ Agents can query state and output actions
7. ‚úÖ Random agent is implemented (+ FirstAvailableAgent bonus!)
8. ‚è≥ **A human can play a full battle against a random agent on a local Showdown server** (NEEDS run_battle.py)

**Acceptance Test:**
- Start local Showdown server
- Run `python/scripts/run_battle.py --opponent random`
- Human picks moves via CLI
- Random agent picks random moves
- Battle progresses correctly (state updates, HP changes, switches, faints)
- Battle concludes when one team is fully fainted
- Winner is declared correctly

## Next Milestones (After 1.8)

Once the first milestone is complete, future milestones might include:

**Milestone 2: Advanced Game Mechanics**
- Full damage calculator
- Ability effects
- Item effects
- Complex move effects
- Entry hazard damage
- Proper RNG and speed ties

**Milestone 3: Replay System**
- Parse Showdown replays
- Generate training datasets
- Replay validation against state transitions

**Milestone 4: LLM Agents**
- Implement LLM-based agent
- Tool integration for agents
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Model comparison (GPT vs Claude vs Llama)

**Milestone 5: Evaluation Framework**
- Win rate evaluation
- Replay matching evaluation
- LLM judge evaluation
- Elo rating system

But those come **after** we have a working human vs. random agent battle!
